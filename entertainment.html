              <p>’Tis always a glorious day when Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth herself graces the Shire of Mount Hope!
                Join the citizens of the Shire and share in their excitement as they greet the Queen, Her retinue, and
                any surprise guests that may show up with intentions of their own! </p>

              <p>With such high expectations to entertain the Queen and her royal retinue, only Mount Hope could meet
                this challenge with this much spectacle and mirth! Watch as the Masters of Revels and the good people of
                the Shire deftly entertain with music, dance, and jests that could only be matched by Dionysus
                themselves. </p>

              <p>Just because the Queen is on the Shire doesn’t mean the people of Mount Hope need to take themselves
                seriously all day! Come join the Shire folk as they engage in some games of Wit, Hilarity, and Downright
                Silliness; all based on suggestions from the audience, so every show is different! </p>

              <p>When the value of the Shire is questioned, the Masters of Revels decide to dispense with the pretenses
                of a Human Chess Match, and get right to the violence! A Tournament of Arms in which the citizens of
                Mount Hope display their bravery, cunning, and skill. Some more skilled than others. And a little side
                betting amongst the nobility never hurt anyone. </p>
