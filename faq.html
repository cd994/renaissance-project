              <p class="faq-text">
                To better serve our guests, we have eliminated the need for coupons to save on your Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire admission tickets.

Because all tickets are now being sold in advance, online, previous "at gate" discounts cannot be offered because verification of qualifying status cannot be obtained. We are working with a new box office system and hope to offer new online discounts in the future.

Follow us on Facebook for details on ticket discounts. Ticket purchasers will also be notified by email of any possible discounts.</p>

            <div class='faq-arrow'></div>
              <p class="faq-text">Simply put, the PA Renaissance Faire is not a "pass the hat:" event and is paid for by the King's Purse. Entertainers hired to perform for our guests receive compensation for their performances and need not rely on guests donations for their livelihood. Our admission price reflects the budget necessary to bring the highest quality entertainment to the Faire's many stages and streets. The Mud Beggars are permitted to pass the hat because it reflects how they would have survived in Renaissance England. Additionally, guests may encounter traveling musicians busking on the village streets. This also reflects how traveling musicians made their living. Donations to these performers is always appreciated and always voluntary.</p>
