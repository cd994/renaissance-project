        <p>Get ready to live the excitement and adventure of jousting knights and royal delights with colorfully
          costumed villagers and merrymakers ready to make your visit an unforgettable experience. Musical, stunt and
          theatrical performances, magic acts and comical mud beggars are just a few of the many daily shows! Immerse
          yourself in the days of Merrie Olde England, steeped in the allure of bygone days and knights!</p>

        <p>1585—England has finally established a colony in the New World! Sir Walter Raleigh, one of Elizabeth’s
          favorite privateers and newly appointed Governor of Virginia has made Mount Hope a key trade port, and the
          Shire has never been so prosperous! Of course, where there’s money to be made, there will be people who want
          that money. The Earl whose lands Mount Hope sits upon has suddenly taken interest in the shire which he once
          left alone. Now he’s come to collect his share of the bounty and perhaps set up a more permanent residence
          with little care if he displaces some peasants along the way. Will Her Majesty intervene? Will the Shire ever
          be the same? People will become heroes, heroes will be made legends, and legends will be proven real.</p>
